The game allows players to move the ball and collect golden boxes through multiple interaction methods: **keypad movement**, **index pointing**, and **hand pinching**.

- **Left-hand index pointing:**  
  When the left-hand index finger points, the player directs the ball’s movement along the X–Z plane:

- **Right-hand pinching:**  
  When the right hand is close enough to the ball, the pinch strength passes a defined threshold, and the hand is held above the ground level. In this case, the ball follows the right palm’s position, and the player can carry and move the ball:

**Pilot Study: Comparing Control Methods in Roll-A-Ball**
This prototype experiment evaluates which interaction technique allows users to perform best in the Roll-A-Ball game. We compared the three control methods: left-hand index pointing, right-hand pinching using Leap Motion, and keyboard movement. Participants collect 12 objects sequentially in the arena, with a tutorial phase at the start to familiarize them with the controls and reduce learning effects. Completion time was measured as the main performance metric.

A pilot study, run with a few participants, helped identify potential issues such as Leap Motion mis-tracking, unclear button instructions, and minor interface glitches, which we corrected before running the final test. The completion times reported here are for the last participant using the refined setup: right-hand pinching was the fastest (54.35 sec), followed closely by keyboard movement (57.85 sec), while left-hand pointing was significantly slower (124.01 sec). These results suggest that precision and comfort in the control method strongly influence performance in this task.
